## About me:
I plan to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of development. I strive to deepen my knowledge, improve my skills and gain experience.

My professional experience includes teaching subjects on creating websites using HTML and CSS, layout using the BEM methodology, working with flex and Grid, as well as graphic design in Figma and 3D modeling in Blender. Thanks to this, I learned to explain complex things in an accessible way and effectively convey knowledge.

My strengths are teamwork, attention to detail and focus on results. I can clearly express my thoughts both orally and in writing, quickly adapt to changes and try to keep up with new technologies and trends. I have experience working with animation, creating adaptive interfaces and using the Bootstrap library.

It is important for me to constantly develop, learn new things and solve interesting problems. I am open to development, creative in solving problems and ready to contribute to cool projects. I am confident that working in a professional team will not only help me master new knowledge, but also reveal my potential.
